docker compose up
The above command will create a container and deploy in a single node
as it doesnot have the capability to scale across multiple nodes
in SWARM


But docker STACK has the ability to deploy in multiple nodes as per the
scale configuration

Docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml dineshstack1



To scale a service use either of below commands

 docker service scale dineshservice1=50
 docker service update --replicas=50 dineshservice1
